i got the basic physics running, im not sure though if it is the best way, i also am still having to consider how i will get interations with multiple block typs, now i am working on blocks that are solid only on the top

this is a hodgpodge of all my own designs and a lot of my own code and logic mixed with the logic from a tutorial by chris courses on youtube. ive been trying to only fall back on using it when necessary and improving it where i can.
