## Issues

i got the basic physics running for solid top tiles, spike tiles, and normal solid tiles, im not sure though if it is the best way, i also am still having to consider how i will get laders to work, and i have no idea how im gonna add enimies or colectable objects yet

## credits

this is a hodgpodge of all my own designs and a lot of my own code and logic mixed with the logic from a tutorial by chris courses on youtube. ive been trying to only fall back on using it when necessary and improving it where i can.
